                        <h2>What's the essence of the game?</h2>
                        <p>You have to write your own bot which will get more points then other bots
                            playing Tetris.</p>
                        <p>Each player has its own board. Player can
                            move the figure to the left and right, rotate and land it.
                            Everything works the same way as in classic Tetris, however not all figures
                            appear from the beginng: once you know how to deal with "squares" -
                            the sticks will start appearing, and so on untill you open all figures.</p>
                        <p>The further you go, the more points you earn.
                            The primary way to score points in Tetris is to clear lines by manipulating
                            the figures so that they fill horizontal row within the Matrix. As the figures fall,
                            your goal is to move and spin them so that they line up evenly at the bottom of the Matrix.
                            To clear a line, every square of the row has to be filled.</p>

                        <h2>Registration and client for game</h2>
                        <p>Player has to <a href="register?gameName=tetris">
                            register on the server</a>, by entering the email or name and surname</p>
                        <p>Next, player has to connect to the server <a href="resources/user/tetris-servers.zip">from the code</a>
                            using WebSockets. It's a maven project and it's suitable for playing using JVM languages.
                            The instruction how to run it may be found at the root of the project in README.txt file.</p>
                        <p>Other programming languages are also supported - the sources are available in the same archive.</p>
                        <p>Example of Web adress to connect to the game on the server deployed locally:</p>
                        <pre>ws://server_ip:8080/codenjoy-contest/ws?user=3edq63tw0bq4w4iem7nb&code=12345678901234567890</pre>
                        <p>Here 'user' - player id, and 'code' - player's security token, which can be taken from the address bar
                            of you browser after registration/logging in.</p>

                        <h2>Message format</h2>
                        <p>After connection, the client will start getting a string of characters with
                            the encoded state of the glass in JSON format (every second).
                            The format is following:</p>
                        <pre>{
  'currentFigurePoint':{'x':4,'y':9},
  'currentFigureType':'O',
  'futureFigures':['S', 'Z', 'I', 'O'],
  'layers':[
    '..................
     ........OO........
     ........OO........
     ..................

     ..I...............
     ..I......OO.......
     ..IOO..SSOOZZ.....
     ..IOO.SSIIIIZZ....'
  ]
}</pre>
                        <p>Parameter 'currentFigurePoint' contains coordinates of the new figure.
                            [0, 0] - bottom left corner.</p>
                        <p>Each figure has its owh rotation point.</p>
                        <p><center><img src="img/rotate.png"></center></p>
                        <p>Parameter 'currentFigureType' contains the type of the new figure.</p>
                        <p>Parameter 'futureFigures' contains the info about upcomming figures
                            which will appear after the current one is landed.</p>
                        <p>Parameter 'layers' is an array with the size 1 which contains encoded state of the glass.
                            The length of 'layers[0]' equals to the square area of the field (18 x 18).
                            If you put a newline character every sqrt(length(string)) of characters
                            you'll get a readable view of the glass.</p>

                        <p>First char of the string corresponds to cell located on the upper left
                            corner with coordinates [0, 17].</p>
                        <h2>Symbols meanings</h2>
                        <p>Empty cell in the glass:</p>
                        <pre>NONE('.')</pre>
                        <p>Figures "colors" (which may differ from the real colors on the screen):</p>
                        <pre>YELLOW('O')
BLUE('I')
CYAN('J')
ORANGE('L')
GREEN('S')
RED('Z')
PURPLE('T')</pre>

                        <h2>Manipulation commands</h2>
                        <p>The game has step-by-step format. Every second server sends to your client (bot)
                            the status of the updated glass and waits for response.
                            The player's algorythm must make a decision where to move the figure withing next second.
                            If the algorythm fails to make this decision - the figure falls one cell down.</p>
                        <p>There are several commands: LEFT, RIGHT – to move the figure to the left/right;<br>
                            DOWN - to land the figure;<br>
                            ACT - to rotate the figure 90 degrees clockwise;<br>
                            ACT(2) - to rotate the figure 180 degrees;<br>
                            ACT(3) - to rotate the figure 90 degrees counterclockwise;<br>
                            ACT(0,0) - zeroing glass (as well as for its overflow penalty points will be taken).<br>
                            Movement/rotation/landing commands can be combined by separating them with a comma -
                            this means that a given chain of commands will be executed in one tact.</p>

                        <h2>Scoring</h2>
                        <p>There are bonus and penalty points in this game.
                            For one landed figure you get the number of points equal to its complexity.
                            The simplest figure is O (1 point), then I - 2 points,
                            J - 3 points, L - 4 points, S - 5 points, Z - 6 points, T - 7 points.
                            New figures will appear in the same sequence with every new level (more and more often).</p>
                        <p>You'll get more bonus points for cleared lines.
                            Moreover, the more simultaneously cleared lines - the more profitable.
                            For example, for one cleared line you'll get 10*level points,
                            for 2 cleared lines you'll get 30*level points,
                            3 simultaneously cleared lines will give you 50*level points
                            and 4 simultaneously cleared lines will give you 100*level points.
                            Here level - the level you've currently reached.</p>
                        <p>Do not forget about penalty points!
                            Each overflowed glass will cost you 10*level points earned.
                            You'll lose same amount of points if you reset the glass manually (command ACT(0,0)).
                            The winner will be the one who collects the most points
                            during limited amount of time (final competiton).
                            Scoring rules as well as rules of determining the winner may change.

                        <h2>Client</h2>
                        <p>If <a href="resources/user/tetris-servers.zip">the client</a>
                            is written using programming language you're using -
                            you may have a great possibility to use a higher-level API:
                            Board class - which encapsulates JSON of state,
                            and GlassBoard - which encapsulates tetris glass,
                            has useful methods for analyzing free and occupied cells in the glass.
                            YourSolver class - empty class with one method getAnswer(Board board).
                            You'll have to put your intelligent logic there. You can also put
                            your new method inside Board and GlassBoard classes.</p>
                        <p>First of all you'll have to choose the programming language.
                            Next, open WebSocket client in IDE and run it.
                            Details may be found inside Readme.txt in the root of project.
                            You'll connect to the server following that instructions.
                            Next, you'll have to get the falling figures to obey your commands,
                            play a smart game and win!</p>
